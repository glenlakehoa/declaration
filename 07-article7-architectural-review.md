# Article VII. Architectural Review

## 7.1 Purpose.
In order to maintain a high quality residential development, to assure that all houses and other structures are of appropriate size, harmonious in design, properly located in relationship to neighboring structures and adapted to the terrain of each Lot, Declarant has retained full architectural control as herein provided. Accordingly, no building, fence, wall or other structure of any kind, or alterations or additions or change of exterior appearance thereto shall be commenced, erected or maintained upon the Property or any Lot until the plans and specifications showing the nature, kind, shape, height, materials, color and location of the same shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by Declarant or by the Architectural Control Committee, as defined in Section 7.2 of this Article.

## 7.2 Architectural Review Committee
<ol type="a"><li>So long as Declarant owns any portion of the property subjected to this Declaration, the “Architectural Review Committee” shall mean the Declarant, unless Declarant shall elect to transfer such control to the Association or to an Architectural Review Committee whose members shall be Lot Owners.</li>

<li>The Architectural Review Committee may be established such that it is divided into two (2) subcommittees, with one (1) subcommittee having jurisdiction over modifications and the other having jurisdiction over new construction.</li>

<li>the Board may employ architects, engineers, or other persons as it deems necessary to enable the Architectural Review Committee to perform its review.</li>

<li>The Architectural Review Committee may, from time to time, delegate any of its rights or responsibilities hereunder to one (1) or more duly licensed architects or other qualified Persons, which shall have full authority to act on behalf of the committee for all matters delegated.</li>

<li>Written design guidelines and procedures shall be promulgated for the exercise of this review; which guidelines may be provided to Owners for a reasonable fee.</li>

<li>So long as the Declarant owns any property for development or sale in the Community, the Declarant shall have the right to appoint all members of the Architectural Review Committee. Upon the expiration or earlier surrender in writing of such right, the Board shall appoint the members of the Architectural Review Committee.</li>

<li>At such time as all of the Lots in the Community have been fully developed, permanent improvements constructed thereon, and such Lots have been sold to permanent residents, or at such time as Declarant desires to transfer control to an Architectural Review Committee, the Declarant shall notify the President of the Board of Directors of the Association to that effect. Declarant will then execute a written instrument transferring control to the Board of Directors of the Association and record it in the office of the register of Deeds for Spartanburg County, South Carolina. Thereupon, the Declarant’s rights and obligations as the Architectural Review Committee shall forthwith terminate; and, thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Association shall have the right, power, authority, and obligation to establish a successor Architectural Review Committee and prescribe rules and regulations pursuant to which such Committee shall server and act. Any such successor Architectural Review Committee shall be composed of at least three (3) but not more than seven (7) Owners. The term of each committee member shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Association.
