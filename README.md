>**Editor's Note**: In a judgment by the 7th Judicial Circuit of South Carolina in case 2019CP4203679 (Glenlake Upstate Homeowners Association, Inc. vs REDACTED, defendant, et al) on March 29, 2021, the judge concluded that all property in Phase 2C is bound to the Covenants, despite the lateness in issuing the Fourth Amendment to the CC&R.

>By implication, this also means that all of the other phases that were annexed post-Fourth Amendment (i.e. Phases 3C, 4B, 4C, 5A and 5B), are to be considered covered by the Covenants following the judge's arguments. The Third Amendment is also considered valid following these arguments. In accordance with this judgment, The Third and Fourth Amendment to the Protective Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions have been included in this version.
