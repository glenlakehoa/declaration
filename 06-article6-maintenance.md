# Article VI. Maintenance and Conveyance of Common Area to Association

## 6.1 Association's Responsibility.[^1]
<ol type="a"><li> The Association shall maintain in good repair the Common Area and any Exclusive Common Areas, including (without limitation) maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscaping and improvements situated on the Common Area and Exclusive Common Areas. The Association shall also maintain all lakes and associated dams, if any, in or about the Community or any Lot thereon to the extent maintenance of such lake is required and the lake is not otherwise maintained by a governmental entity or third party. This is a private gated community and all gates and roadways are to be maintained by the Association.</li>

<li>The Association shall also maintain all Community entry features, Common Areas, Exclusive Common Areas, and operate and maintain street lights (If not maintained and operated by a governmental entity) for the Community including the expenses for water and electricity, if any, provided to all such entry features, Common Areas, Exclusive Common Areas, and street lights; all storm water detention facilities and easements serving the Community (to the extent such facilities and easements are not maintained by a governmental entity); and all property outside of Lots located within the Community which was originally maintained by Declarant.</li>

<li>The Association shall have the right, but not the obligation, to maintain other property not owned by the Association, whether within or without the Community, where the Board has determined that such maintenance would benefit the Owners.
<li>In the event that the Association determines that the need for maintenance, repair, or replacement of property described above is caused through the willful or negligent act of an Owner, or the family, guests, lessees, or invitees of any Owner, and is not covered or paid for by insurance, in whole or in part, then the Association may perform such maintenance, repair, or replacement at such Owner's sole cost and expense, and all costs thereof shall be an special assessment against such Owner subject to the Associationâ€˜s lien and collection rights provided for in this Declaration.</li>

<li>All maintenance shall be performed consistent with the Community-Wide Standard.</li>

<li>As to Lots upon which Maintained Single-Family Homes are constructed, in addition to the maintenance of Common Area and the Exclusive Common Area, the Association shall provide yard and exterior grounds maintenance including trees, shrubs, mulched areas and grass. In order to enable the Association to accomplish the foregoing, there is hereby reserved to the Association the right to unobstructed access over and upon each Maintained Single-Family Home Lot in Glenlake at reasonable times to perform such maintenance. All costs associated with such maintenance shall be the exclusive and sole responsibility of the owners of the Maintained SingleFamily Homes Lots in the Community and shall be collected from said Owners as assessments thereon as provided for herein and in Article V of the Declaration.</li>

<li>As to Lots upon which Maintained Single-Family Homes are constructed, Owners may fence in or screen their decks or patio areas; however, any Owner who fences or screens such areas shall first obtain the written approval of the Association. The Owners of such Lots shall not plant any vegetation in the front or back of his/her Residence, except with the prior written approval of the Association and the maintenance of any such plantings shall be at the Owners sole cost and expense. If, in the opinion of the Association, any such Owner fails to maintain his/her plantings in a neat and orderly manner, the Association may maintain the same and separately assess such Owner for the addition cost of such additional maintenance.</li>

<li>In the event that the Association determines that additional maintenance or repair of the yard and/or exterior grounds of any Maintained Single-Family Home Lot is required as a result of the actions or negligence of the Owner of such Lot, the Association reserves the right to perform such maintenance and/or repair itself and to assess the Owner the cost of the same separately in addition to the regular maintenance assessments described herein.</li>
</ol>

## 6.2 Owner's Responsibility.
Except as provided in Section 6.1(a) above, all maintenance of the Lot and all structures, parking areas, landscaping, and other improvements thereon shall be the sole responsibility of the Owner thereof, who shall maintain such Lot in a manner consistent with the Community-Wide Standard and this Declaration. In the event that the Board determines that any Owner has failed or refused to discharge properly any of such Owner's obligations with regard to the maintenance, repair, or replacement of items for which such Owner is responsible, the Association may perform such maintenance, repair, or replacement for the Owner at the expense of the Owner. Except in an emergency situation, the Association shall give the Owner written notice of the Association's intent to provide such necessary maintenance, repair, or replacement. The notice shall set forth with reasonable particularity the maintenance, repairs, or replacement deemed necessary. The Owner shall have ten (10) days after receipt of such notice within which to complete such maintenance, repair, or replacement or, in the event that such maintenance, repair, or replacement is not capable of completion within a ten (10) day period, to commence such work, which shall be completed within a reasonable time. If any Owner does not comply with the provisions hereof, the Association may provide any such maintenance, repair, or replacement at such Owner's sole cost and expense, and all costs shall be assessed against the Owner as a special assessment.

## 6.3 Conveyance of Common Area by Declarant to Association.
The Declarant may convey to the Association any personal property, any improved or unimproved real property, leasehold, easement, or other property interest located within or adjacent to the Community. Such conveyance shall be accepted by the Association, and the property shall thereafter be Common Area to be maintained by the Association for the benefit of all or a part of its members.
