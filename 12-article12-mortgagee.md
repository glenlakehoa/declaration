  <li>any lapse, cancellation, or material modification of any insurance policy maintained by the Association.</li>
</ol>

## 12.2 No priority.
No provision of this Declaration or the By-Laws gives, or shall be construed as giving, any Owner or other party priority over any rights of the first Mortgagee of any Lot in the case of distribution to such Owner of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards for losses to, or a taking of, the Common Area.

## 12.3 Notice to Association.
Upon request, each Owner shall be obligated to furnish to the Association the name and address of the holder of any Mortgage encumbering such Owner's Lot.

As long as the Declarant has the right to appoint and remove the directors of the Association and so long as the project is approved by the US. Department of Housing and Urban  Development ("HUD"), or the US. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"), for insuring or guaranteeing any Mortgage in the Community, the following actions shall require the prior approval of the VA or HUD as applicable: annexation of additional property to the Community, except for annexation by Declarant in accordance herewith or pursuant to a plan of annexation previously approved by the VA or HUD as applicable; dedication of Common Area to any public entity; mergers and consolidations of the Association; dissolution of the Association; and material amendment of the Declaration, By-Laws, or Articles of Incorporation. 

## 12.5 Applicability of Article.
Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to reduce the percentage vote that must otherwise be obtained under the Declaration, By-Laws, or South Carolina law for any of the acts set out in this Article.

## 12.6 Amendments by the Board.
Should the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, HUD, or VA subsequently delete any of their respective requirements which necessitate the provision of this Article or make any such requirements less stringent, the Board, without approval of the Owners, may cause an amendment to this Article to be recorded to reflect such changes.
